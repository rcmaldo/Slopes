# Slopes
Experimental platformer game on Flash

This is where my game development got intense. Do note that Flash did not have a proper physics engine. Most physics were own code.

Controls: LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys for movement, SPACE to jump/double jump/wall jump

Lots of features, not limited to:

-dynamic, smoothing camera

-editable platforms

-smooth movements

-actual wall-runs

-character self-fixes rotation, can be used to perform backflips/frontflips

-others
